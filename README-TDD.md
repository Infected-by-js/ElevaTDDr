# ðŸ§ª TDD Test Cases for Elevator Simulator (structured by TDD steps)

> Each step corresponds to a test-driven development stage: 
> TEST -> IMPLEMENTATION -> REFACTOR.

## Step 1: Basic Model (Unit Tests)

Goal - create a minimal working elevator model with API, initial state and basic logic.

| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Elevator Creation                      | Verify that elevator is created                         | Initial structure and model initialization |
| Initial State                          | Check that elevator starts on 1st floor                 | Set starting floor                         |
| Empty Queue                            | Queue should be empty                                   | Ensure no default requests                 |
| Method Availability Check              | All public elevator methods are accessible and callable | Prepare for API usage                      |
| Elevator Doesn't Start Automatically   | After creation elevator doesn't start moving            | Verify control only through calls          |

| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Up Call                       | Call from floor (up) is added to queue       | Basic call registration                |
| Down Call                     | Call from floor (down) is added to queue     | Check direction and addition           |
| Repeated Call Ignored         | Repeated call is not duplicated              | Prevent flooding                       |
| Movement Direction Processing | Call in same direction is processed en route | Route optimization                     |
| Elevator Call During Movement | Call is processed while moving               | Dynamic queue                          |
| Call from Non-existent Floor  | Attempt to call from invalid number          | Input validation                       |

| Floor Transitions       | Elevator moves on command                 | Basic movement simulation     |
| Transition to Wait Mode | Empty queue - Idle status                 | State management              |
| Wait Before Movement    | Elevator waits 5 seconds before new call  | Simulate passenger entry/exit |
